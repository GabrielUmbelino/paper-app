## Objective
With this project, I had the objective of training my web development skills using the React library. Having it in mind, I created A text editor app that is possible to create and edit multiple text files.

## Challenges
* Testing: While I was writing this project I used the TDD(Test Driven Development) technique.
I am not used to write code using it, so in the begging it was a little bit of struggling to write components without knowing exactly how it was going to end up looking like, but after a while, you get used to it and start enjoying the advantages of TDD.

* Choosing the right text editing framework: Choosing frameworks is always hard because there is a lot of options and most of them don't have very good documentation, but after testing some of them I end up choosing draft.js that showed been a very good choice even don't have very good typescript support.
