## Objective

The objective of this project was to practice my web development skills using the React library. Having this in mind, I created a text editor app that enables the production and edition of multiple text files.

## Challenges

- Testing: While writing the project, I used the TDD (Test Driven Development) technique. I do not use to write code with it, so, at first, I struggled a little bit as I had to write components not knowing exactly how they were going to end up looking like, but, after a while, I got familiarized with it and began to enjoy the TDD advantages.

- Choosing the right text editing framework: Choosing frameworks can be very hard, as there are many options available and most of them don't have well organized documentation. Nevertheless, after testing some of them I ended up opting for draft.js, which has shown to be a great choice, even if it does not have a very good typescript support.
